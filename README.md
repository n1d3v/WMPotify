## **Installation** / Updating

### **Manual installation using Scripts (recommended):**

#### **Windows (Powershell)**

* WMPotify + WMPotify NowPlaying + Windhawk + CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod
    * This script detects whether Spotify, Spiceify, Windhawk, and CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod are installed or not. If not, it will install them.
    * If Windhawk is installed and CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod is up-to-date, the installation of these two will be skipped.

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') }"
```

* Theme only:
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Install @('wmpotify')"
```

* WMPotify NowPlaying only:
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Install @('wmpvis')"
```

#### **Linux/macOS (Bash)**

* Note: Not tested on macOS yet

* WMPotify + WMPotify NowPlaying
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.sh | sh
```

* WMPotify NowPlaying only:
```bash
export SKIP_THEME=true
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.sh | sh
```

### **Manual installation**
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/releases)
2. Locate Spicetify directories: use `spicetify config-dir` or `spicetify path userdata`
3. Extract the contents of the WMPotify zip to the `Themes\WMPotify` folder in the Spicetify directory. Create the `Themes\WMPotify` folder if it doesn't exist.
4. Extract the contents of the WMPotify NowPlaying zip to the `CustomApps\wmpvis` folder in the Spicetify directory. Create the `CustomApps\wmpvis` folder if it doesn't exist.
5. Run the following commands in Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal:
    ```cmd
    spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 inject_theme_js 1
    spicetify config current_theme WMPotify
    spicetify config custom_apps wmpvis
    spicetify apply
    ```
6. Windows only: Install [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) and [CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod](https://windhawk.net/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal) for the full experience (optional but recommended)

### **Using Spicetify Marketplace (simpler installation):**

1. Install the `spicetify-marketplace` extension following its instructions: [https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace/wiki/Installation).
2. Search for "WMPotify" in the Spicetify Marketplace and click "Install."
* Warning: The Spicetify Marketplace version may load slowly due to the large number of images in the theme.

## **Uninstallation**

### **Manual uninstallation using Scripts (recommended):**

#### **Windows (Powershell)**
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Action Uninstall"
```

#### **Linux/macOS (Bash)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/uninstall.sh | sh
```

### **Manual uninstallation**
1. Run the following commands in Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal:
    ```cmd
    spicetify config custom_apps wmpvis-
    spicetify config current_theme marketplace
    spicetify apply
    ```
    Replace the second line with `spicetify config current_theme " "` if you don't plan to use themes from the Spicetify Marketplace, or you don't have Marketplace installed.
2. Delete the `Themes\WMPotify` and `CustomApps\wmpvis` folders in the Spicetify directory. Find the directory with `spicetify config-dir` or `spicetify path userdata`.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Q:** Queue list does not show up in the right panel
    * **A:** Check `Enable Queue on the right panel.` in the user button -> `Experimental features`.
    * If this still does not work and the Experimental features popup shows `Using fallback mode`, you need to downgrade Spotify to a version fully supported by Spicetify. Old releases are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wztO1L4zvNykBRw7X4jxP8pvo11oQjT0O5DvZ_-S4Ok/edit?pli=1&gid=803394557#gid=803394557)
2. **Q:** Aero Glass or the mini mode does not work
    * **A:** Currently those features are only available on Windows, and if you have installed the [CEF/Spotify Tweaks](https://windhawk.net/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal) [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) mod. macOS and Linux are not supported now, and it needs more research to implement them.
    * For the mini mode, you might get it working by force resizing the window to a smaller size with an external tool. I will implement a custom miniplayer in the future that looks like the mini mode.
3. **Q.** Custom title bar only shows the close button
    * **A.** Either the CEF/Spotify Tweaks Windhawk mod or the Spotify API Extender Chrome extension required for the minimize/maximize/restore buttons to show up. The extension is available in the [SpotifyCrExt](/SpotifyCrExt) folder in the repository.
    * Using the extension is only recommended if you cannot use the Windhawk mod, such as on Linux or macOS.
    * To install the extension, you have to enable DevTools with `spicetify enable-devtools`, right-click any empty space, click `Show Chrome Tools`, open `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, and load the unpacked extension. If the extension installation doesn't work, run `spicetify enable-devtools` again and try again.
    * Note that Chrome extensions only work if DevTools is enabled. Spotify will randomly disable DevTools after a while and all extensions will stop working. To permanently enable DevTools and extensions, hex-patch the Spotify executable to fill the `disable-extensions` string to something invalid.
4. **Q:** This theme is too slow!
    * **A1:** Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled in Spotify settings. 
    * **A2:** Remove the Beautiful Lyrics extension if you have it installed. This extension is known to slow down Spotify. This theme doesn't really support the extension either. Use WMPotify NowPlaying instead.
